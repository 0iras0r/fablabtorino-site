**bitSkin** is a project of an interactive physical system that investigate new processes in the field of dressmaking. The intent is to look for processes that integrate the digital fabrication tools that we can find within a FabLab but speaking the same language of the craftsman, helping them to understand new possibility. bitSkin is a meter arduino based that through an algorithm can generate a dress varying parametrically the pattern, that we can export and directlly cut with a laser cutter the pieces of fabric that compose our dress.
